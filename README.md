# CPU Scheduling Algorithm Simulator

## Visualize and Understand Complex Scheduling Algorithms with Ease

In the world of operating systems, CPU scheduling is a fundamental concept that determines the efficiency and performance of a system. However, understanding how different scheduling algorithms work can be a challenging task. This project, the **CPU Scheduling Algorithm Simulator**, is a powerful tool designed to help students, educators, and developers visualize and comprehend the intricacies of CPU scheduling in a user-friendly and interactive environment.

Our simulator provides a hands-on approach to learning, allowing you to experiment with various scheduling algorithms, input your own processes, and instantly see the results. Whether you're a student preparing for an exam, an educator looking for a dynamic teaching aid, or a developer seeking to optimize system performance, our simulator is the perfect companion for your journey into the world of operating systems.

## Key Features

*   **üìä Comprehensive Algorithm Support:** Visualize and compare a wide range of scheduling algorithms, including:
    *   **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):** The simplest scheduling algorithm where processes are executed in the order they arrive.
        <img src="images/fcfs.svg" width="400"/>
    *   **Shortest Job First (SJF):** A non-preemptive algorithm that selects the process with the smallest execution time.

*   **‚öôÔ∏è Customizable Process Management:** Take full control of your simulations by adding, removing, and clearing processes with customizable attributes such as:
    *   Process ID
    *   Arrival Time
    *   Burst Time
    *   Priority
*   **üìà In-Depth Performance Analysis:** Gain valuable insights into the performance of each algorithm with a comprehensive set of calculated metrics:
    *   Completion Time
    *   Turnaround Time
    *   Waiting Time
    *   Response Time
    *   Average Turnaround Time
    *   Average Waiting Time
    *   Throughput
*   **üé® Intuitive and Interactive GUI:** Our user-friendly interface, built with JavaFX, provides a seamless and engaging experience, making it easy to input data and visualize the scheduling process in real-time.
