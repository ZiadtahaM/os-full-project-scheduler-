# CPU Scheduling Simulator

This project is a JavaFX application that simulates various CPU scheduling algorithms. It provides a graphical user interface to visualize the execution of processes and analyze their performance based on different scheduling strategies.

## Features

*   **Process Management:** Add, remove, and clear processes with attributes like Process ID, Arrival Time, Burst Time, and Priority.
*   **Scheduling Algorithms:** Implements the following CPU scheduling algorithms:
    *   First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
    *   Shortest Job First (SJF)
    *   Priority Scheduling
    *   Round Robin (RR)
*   **Performance Metrics:** Calculates and displays key performance indicators for each algorithm:
    *   Completion Time
    *   Turnaround Time
    *   Waiting Time
    *   Response Time
    *   Average Turnaround Time
    *   Average Waiting Time
    *   Throughput
*   **Interactive GUI:** A user-friendly interface built with JavaFX to input data and visualize the results.
